# LockButtons
A simple tweak to disable all the physical buttons on a device with the option of allowing the lock button

This is my first fully fleshed out and finished tweak so if anyone finds any bugs please let me know. I also encourage people to look at the code and learn some of the techniques. We need more open source simple tweaks!
